# 1. Detail work you've completed in Sprint 2
### Frontend
First, we made many changes to how the application looks. For our previous sprint, we were only able to display the basic layout and buttons of our application, however for this sprint we focused on making the app look more visually appealing. Some changes we made to do so include:
- Making a navigation bar that is responsive and that matches the color scheme of our app
- Adding a home image to start fleshing out our information page, which is the first thing the user will see
- Cleaning up the sign up/login forms
  - Making them look better
  - Removing out unecessary fields and adding new ones
- Fixing uneven centering and inconsistent spacing across devices
- Fixing bugs from last sprint (such as unclickable buttons)

In order to plan out how the rest of the app, the frontend team met up and created a mockup of how we want the app to look like.

We also configured Cypress and wrote our first Cypress test.

Finally, we worked on integrating the frontend with the backend alongside the backend team and writing up additional unit tests to accompany the functions that we wrote.
