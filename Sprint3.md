# 1. Detail work you've completed in Sprint 2
### Frontend
This sprint, we started implementing the main features of our app that would be displayed on the main page. These features are:
- Navigation bar
	- This is a new navigation bar that replaces the one that was on the login/sign-up/home page once the user logs in.
	- Displays the name of the project
	- Displays a progress bar that illustrats the completion status of the user's assigned tasks
	- Includes buttons for Timeline and Sign Out
	- Includes a sidebar button that can be pressed to reveal the sidebar
- Sidebar
  - Revealed by pressing the hamburger icon in the navigation bar
  - Includes the options to Add New Task, Manage Member Tags, and Sign Out
  - Can be closed by preassing the menu icon a second time
- Task Cards
  - One card for each task laid out in a vertical list format
  - Includes information about each task such as
    - Title
    - Due Date
    - Completion Status
    - Tag list
    - Details Button
- Task Details Modal
  - Allows users to edit tasks that have already been created
  - Opened up when the user clicks the "Details" button on a task card
  - We have not finished implementing this feature
  - Will be reused in our Add Task feature, which allows the user to create a new task
